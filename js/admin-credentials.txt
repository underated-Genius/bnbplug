## Security Notes:
- In production, NEVER store passwords in client-side code
- Use server-side authentication with hashed passwords

- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Regularly update admin passwords

## Best Practices:
1. Create unique admin accounts for each administrator
2. Use strong passwords (min 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. Enable two-factor authentication if possible
4. Log all admin activities
5. Regularly review admin access

## Emergency Access:
If you lose admin access, you can reset by:
1. Clearing browser localStorage
2. Using the default credentials above
3. Or editing the auth.js file directly

## File Structure for Admin Access:
